A bunch of small Sphinx extensions which make I have created as part of using
Sphinx.

# Extensions

## [`harden_xml`](harden_xml)

A module which monkey patches the XML reading to make it more tolerant of bad
and incorrectly formatted XML files.

## [`sphinx-contrib-exhale-multiproject`](sphinx-contrib-exhale-multiproject)

A Sphinx extension which extends [Exhale](https://exhale.readthedocs.io) to
allow it to generate for multiple separate projects at once.

## [`sphinx-contrib-markdown-links`](sphinx-contrib-markdown-links)

A Sphinx extension which allows you to symlink Markdown files from other parts
of your code base into the Sphinx docs and have things like links continue to
work.
